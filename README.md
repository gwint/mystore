MyStore is a distributed key-value store for string storage.  It is a decentralized
system that consists of processes, called nodes, running on serveral machines.  MyStore
is written in C++ and utilizes the Apache Thrift for remote procedure calls.  The RAFT
consensus algorithm is used to manage the replicated log that holds the mappings stored
within the system.  See the below resources for more information about RAFT:

- [In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf)
- [Raft Visualization](https://raft.github.io/)

## Requirements

- C++ >= 14
- cmake >= 3.17.2
- Python >= 3.7 (used for command line tool)
- For use with the command line tool:
	- The most recent version of the following Python modules: thrift, python-dotenv
- Apache Thrift version >= 0.13.0
- A Github Account (to pull in external projects used for logging and .env file reading during build)

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gwint/mystore.git
$ Add location of libthrift-0.14.2.so to LD_LIBRARY_PATH (On ubuntu 20.10, /usr/local/lib was the path I used)
$ cd mystore
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
Repeat these steps on each machine that will be apart of the MyStore cluster.

## Start up and interact with a MyStore cluster

While inside the mystore directory, runnning ./build/MyStore <port-number> will
start a MyStore node listening on a port represented by <port-number>.  Once this has been done on
all machines whose information is included in cluster.membership, a command line tool can be used to
start the cluster's operation and store/retrieve mappings from the cluster.  For example, the following commands
will start the cluster, store a key-value pair within the cluster, and then retrieve the value associated with
the stored key:

```
$ ./mystore start
$ ./mystore put -target=127.0.1.1:5000 akey aval
$ ./mystore get akey
```

Notice that the -target option is used on the call to put: this is because the mystore client does not keep information about the 
cluster members.  Instead it builds up an understanding of the cluster over time as it interacts with it.  As as a result, the first command
run using the mystore command line tool must specify a socket address to use as the target for the command.  Subsequent command do not require use
of the target option.
